# Import CAD files to Ployly Dash graphs

Currently supported, to varying degrees in order of support:

- DXF (using [ezdxf](https://pypi.org/project/ezdxf/))
- IGES (using [pyiges](https://github.com/pyvista/pyiges))
- SVG by just parsing SVG as an xml file using builtin python modules

Very much a WIP - we are adding as we need to. 

### Project aim
Plot a fairly untailored CAD file to a dash graph
